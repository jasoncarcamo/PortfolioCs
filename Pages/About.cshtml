<h1>About</h1>

<section id="about-section">
    <p>
        I create full stack web applications from scratch or with fun frameworks and libraries. I create RESTful APIs and React applications on my free time, while also learning new technologies and software best practices.
    </p>
    <p>Databases are fun for me because I get to use SQL and visualize data to see universal patterns with relational databases. Seeing patterns and noticing trends come naturally as I have an eye for detail. Finding solutions to big problems is never hard when I plan, organize and break problems into small pieces. I look forward to further my web development skills and excited to pick up the right tools for the job. </p>
